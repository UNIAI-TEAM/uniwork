# Office web modules: PDF, Markdown, HTML, Slides, Sheets in the web frame (UNI-1014/1015/1016)

The Docs web frame (`docs/office/docs-web-frame.md`, UNI-1013) is generalised to
every genoffice module. There is one protocol, one frame host, one set of
`/api/v1/office-frame/*` routes and one sync script; each of them takes a
module. Docs keeps every name, URL, pin and test it had.

| module | format | flag (default off) | issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docs` | docx | `office_docs_web` | UNI-1013 |
| `pdf` | pdf | `office_pdf_web` | UNI-1014 |
| `markdown` | md | `office_markdown_web` | UNI-1014 |
| `html` | html | `office_html_web` | UNI-1014 |
| `slides` | pptx | `office_slides_web` | UNI-1015 |
| `sheets` | xlsx | `office_sheets_web` | UNI-1016 |

xls, odt and every other format have no web module and keep the G3 host (or
its unsupported state).

## Server: the module is in the token

- `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}/office/frame-token` derives the module from the
  document's stored file, never from the client
  (`server/internal/service/office_frame_module.go`: a DOCX keeps the Docs
  rule, mime or `.docx`; any other format is judged as the Office editor
  judges it, extension first, then the verified content type). A format with
  no module answers 404 as before; a module whose flag is off for the
  document's organization answers 403 `feature_disabled`, as Docs always did.
- The token carries the module as claim `m`. Docs tokens carry none, so a
  token minted before modules existed is still valid and still means docs; an
  explicit `"m":"docs"` or an unknown module is refused.
- Every frame route evaluates the flag of the token's module, for the token's
  organization, inside the frame-auth middleware (only the token names the
  module): off answers 404 `feature_disabled`, the same answer the old
  route-level `office_docs_web` gate gave. A Docs token cannot pass on the
  PDF flag and the other way round.
- `Authorize` refuses a token whose document's current version is no longer of
  the token's module (404), and recents list only the token's module.
- The routes stay generic (open, content, uploads, commit, recents, assets).
  `export/pdf` is the Docs renderer and answers 501 `unsupported_operation`
  to any other module's token; the frame prints in place.
- Mint and open answers carry `module`.

## Bundles, pins, sync, headers (`apps/web`)

- One pin per module: `apps/web/platform/office-frame/<module>.pin.json`
  (`docs.pin.json` unchanged; the other modules have none until their worker
  pins a build). The manifest may name its `module`; absent is docs, and a
  build is refused for a module it does not name.
- `office-frame-sync.mjs`: `--module <m>` (default docs), `--all` (every pinned
  module; with `--pin`, every module present in the source), `--check` takes
  the same selection, and `--ensure` (the `pnpm build` / `pnpm dev` hook)
  checks every pinned module and syncs the missing ones. `OFFICE_FRAME_SOURCE`
  may be a dist-web root holding `<module>/<version>/` (the fork's
  `build:web:all`, or a `.tar.gz` of it), one module's directory (the docs-only
  layout of UNI-1013 keeps working), or a version directory.
- Installs go to `public/office-frame/<module>/<version>/`, served at
  `/office-frame/<module>/<version>/index.html`.
- Headers: every `/office-frame/**` path first gets the locked-down policy
  (`default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'self'`); each module's rule follows
  and gives `/office-frame/<module>/**` that module's pinned CSP and extra
  headers (Next applies matching rules in order and the last value of a header
  wins), with the same caching split per module. One module's pin never
  reaches another module's paths.
- `next.config.mjs` inlines `NEXT_PUBLIC_OFFICE_FRAME_VERSIONS`, a JSON map of
  the modules whose pinned bundle is installed and verifies, and keeps
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_OFFICE_DOCS_FRAME_VERSION` for docs.

## Host (`packages/views/office/frame`, `apps/web/platform`)

- `OfficeModuleFrame` (frame src, the module's default API, the expected
  module) and `OfficeModuleOpenSwitch` (the module's flag, refusal fallback)
  are the generic pieces; `OfficeDocsFrame` and `DocxOpenSwitch` are wrappers
  for docs.
- The vendored host is given the module: a frame whose `ready.module` differs
  fails the handshake with `malformed` before any `init`, and `init.module`
  names it. A Docs bundle from before the field says no module, which is docs.
- Capabilities come from one table, `officeModuleSpec(module).grant` in
  `packages/core/office/office-modules.ts`, narrowed by readonly and by the
  API. Docs has its UNI-1013 grant; every other module grants nothing (save,
  save-as, recents, print, export, images, attachments off) until its worker
  turns on what its frame implements.
- `createOfficeFrameApi(module)` is the API over the same routes: a save
  uploads the module's mime type under the stored name, a save-as appends the
  module's extension, and only docs has `export`.
- `document-office-host.tsx` routes pdf/md/html/pptx/xlsx through
  `ModuleFrameOrG3Host` only when `pinnedFrameVersion(module)` is set; without
  an installed bundle the existing G3 host renders exactly as before.

## Not done here

Module bundles, pins and module-specific capability keys belong to the module
workers. The Sheets sidecar question (GO-D3) keeps sidecar-only operations
hidden through capability keys.
