-- ai_attachment (UNI-2119): a file attached to an Ask UNI question. It belongs
-- to one workspace, so it joins the org+workspace branch beside
-- document_file. Both checks are restated in full, as every purpose change
-- before this did. chat_room_wallpaper is listed too: its migration added the
-- purpose to FileService but never to these checks, so a wallpaper upload
-- would have been refused here; like the other chat rooms it names an
-- organization and an optional workspace.
