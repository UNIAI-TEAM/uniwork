-- chat_link_preview (ADR 0035) joins the organization-only branch beside the
-- exports: a preview picture belongs to the organization's URL cache, shared
-- by every room that links the URL, so it names no workspace. It is a tenant
-- file, never the NULL tenant (ADR 0023). Both checks are restated in full,
-- as every purpose change before this did.
